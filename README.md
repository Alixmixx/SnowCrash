# Project SnowCrash

## Introduction
This repository contains our solutions to the "Project SnowCrash," focusing on elf-like binary exploitation in i386 systems. Each solution demonstrates an understanding of RAM and security principles crucial for developing secure software.

## Project Structure
The project is structured with directories for each level, containing the exploited binary, a walkthrough of the solution, and any additional resources used.
The complete Pdf is available at the root of the project

## Solutions Overview
Each level directory contains:
- `source`: The source code or a detailed description of the exploited binary.
- `walkthrough`: A step-by-step guide explaining how the solution was reached.
- `flag`: The output or key result obtained from the level (if applicable).
- `Ressources`: Additional resources or scripts used in the solution.

## Key Learnings
- A deeper understanding of binary exploitation.
- Insights into common security vulnerabilities in programming.
- Development of critical problem-solving skills in IT security.

## Disclaimer
These solutions are part of an educational project. They are meant for learning and demonstrating security concepts in software development.
